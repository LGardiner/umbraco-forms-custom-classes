# Umbraco forms custom classes
### An umbraco extension to improve flexibility around umbraco forms styling and front end. 

Recreates the basic umbraco forms field types but adds a two properties, "Custom Class" and "Custom Property". These can be updated from the form editor and used to style the front end with more flexibility. Designed to be used in conjunction with Umbraco Form themes.
